# odin-recipes

This project entails creating a website that contains recipes for different kinds of food. It's important to note that the website will be made using only HTML and CSS, so that I am able to demonstrate what I have learned so far in the HTML and CSS sections of the course. After I completed this project, I learned how to efficiently display headings, images, paragraphs, and lists coherently together. In addition, I also learned how to provide basic stylings to my web pages by altering background color, text color, font-size, and also through the use of bolding certain headings. This not only allowed for an appropriete and well user experience, but also allowed them to understand how to cook different foods fully.
