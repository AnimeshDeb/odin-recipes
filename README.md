# odin-recipes
This project entails creating a website that contains recipes for different kinds of food. It's important to note that the website will be made using only HTML, so that I am able to demonstrate what I have learned so far in the HTML section of course. After I completed this project, I learned how to efficiently display headings, images, paragraphs, and lists coherently together. This not only allowed for an appropriete and well user experience, but also allowed them to understand how to cook different foods fully.
